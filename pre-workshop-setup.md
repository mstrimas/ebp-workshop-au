Hi,
 
You're receiving this email because you've signed up for the eBird Best Practices workshop at {}. To ensure everything runs smoothly, and so we can dive right into the fun stuff without wasting too much time on setup, we have some pre-workshop tasks we'd like you to complete before the workshop. The following steps should only take about 30 minutes:
 
1. [Install or update R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) to ensure you have at least version 3.5.0.
2. [Install or update RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) to ensure you have the latest version. Even if you don't normally use RStudio, we suggest you install it since we'll be using it for the workshop and it'll make it easier to follow along.
3. Run the following two lines of R code to install all the packages necessary for the workshop:
    - install.packages("remotes")
    - remotes::install_github("mstrimas/ebppackages")
4. If you're a Windows user, [install Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/install.html) to provide access to the Unix command line tools that we'll be using in the workshops.
5. Run [this code snippet](https://gist.github.com/mstrimas/d61bfc616082894b3f4ca62a6a8bba15) to check that everything is installed correctly. This code should print out "Blue Jay". If it doesn't, or if you get an error, email me.
6. If you don't already have an eBird account, [create one](https://secure.birds.cornell.edu/cassso/account/create).
7. Visit the [eBird Data Access](https://ebird.org/data/download) page and request access to the eBird Basic Dataset if you haven't already. Be sure to mention that your part of the eBird Best Practices workshop in your request.
 
Completing these steps in advance of the workshop will save us time and ensure everyone is working with the same set of tools, reducing errors and making troubleshooting easier. If you have any problems completing this setup please email me and I'll help you. Thanks and see you soon!
